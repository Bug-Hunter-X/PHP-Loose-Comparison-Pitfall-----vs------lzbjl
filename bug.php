In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error is the misuse of the `==` (loose comparison) operator instead of the `===` (strict comparison) operator.  This can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.

For example:

```php
$a = 1;
$b = "1";

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not equal";
}
```

This code will output "Equal" because loose comparison does type coercion.  However, if you intend to compare both value and type, you should use strict comparison:

```php
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not equal";
}
```

Now the output will be "Not equal", reflecting the different types.
